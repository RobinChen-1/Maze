# Root Directory

## `MainController.py`

This is the file that is run to start the game. We don’t need to edit this file, but when we want to run the game, this is the file that is run. 

## `LICENCE`

The License file is not a part of the game. It lays out the rules around using and distributing GameFrame. The License is the Gnu General Public License, which basically means you can use it however you like, but you can’t stop anyone else from using it, and if you make changes to GameFrame itself (the files inside the GameFrame folder) and want to share it with other people, you can do that as well (It’s not stealing. You are allowed to do that!) 

## `README.md` 

This file contains a brief description of GameFrame. We do not need to edit this file. It is used to provide a description on GitHub for people who want to know what the project is about. You can delete this file if you like, but leaving it doesn’t cause any problems.
